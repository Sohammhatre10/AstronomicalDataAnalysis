Creating an HR Diagram

The H-R diagram is a useful tool for astronomers because it can be used to chart the life cycle of a star. It can also be used to study groups of stars in galaxies or clusters. The H-R diagram plots the following two primary characteristics of a star: Luminosity: The brightness or output of energy Temperature: The average speed of moving particles

The Hertzsprung-Russell diagram (H-R diagram) is a scatter plot that shows the relationship between a star's absolute magnitude and its temperature. It's also known as the color-magnitude diagram.
